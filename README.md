# VueNotes

This is an application developed with Vuejs, Nodejs, express and webpack.

It is an application in which you can add your reminders and give them a priority, the reminders will be sorted automatically by priority. You can also mark them as completed (and remove them if they do not) and delete all your completed tasks at once. Very satisfying!

Every time you create or delete a note you will have an animation, and you can also filter the notes, if you are a very clueless person you can search among all your reminders that you forgot. All notes will have a creation date and can be deleted when you want.

It also has a section to watch the weather, so if you activate your geolocation (I recommend it) the web will show you live much information about the time you do where you are. Have a little patience sometimes going a little slow in displaying the data.
